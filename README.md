### Techniques 

This is a project created for personal educational purposes, with the aim of testing and gaining better experience with computer graphics techniques and the unity workflow in general. Said techniques include:

- Prodedural planets and terrains.
- Procedural texturing of the terrain, based on terrain height and slope.
- Shader-based effects
- Particle effects
- UI
- Operations with Unity Phisics Engine

This does not claim to be a full-game, and all rights are reserved to their respective owners of the third party models imported in the game. More features and full gameplay mechanics might be added in later stages of development, as well as small fixes and improvements.

This project is inspired by the amazing work of Sebastian Lague on procedurally generated planets. I hope that this prototype can be of inspiration for other developers as well.
